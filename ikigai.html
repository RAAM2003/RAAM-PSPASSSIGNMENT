      <center><h1>IKIGAI</h1></center>
      <p>According to the Japanese, everyone has an ikigai—what a French philosopher
might call a raison d’être. Some people have found their ikigai, while others are
still looking, though they carry it within them.
Our ikigai is hidden deep inside each of us, and finding it requires a patient
search. According to those born on Okinawa, the island with the most
centenarians in the world, our ikigai is the reason we get up in the morning.</p>
